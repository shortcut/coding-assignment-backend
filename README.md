# The Shortcutter's Coding Challenge

Hi! :wave:

Whether you have been sent here by one of our recruitment ninjas, or stumbled upon it by accident, we're excited you're here! We are the leading mobile innovation and app development company from Oslo, Norway. :norway: Nobody in Norway has delivered more apps than us! And while we are *from* Oslo, we've also expanded our Norwegian operation to Bergen, and also work in Denmark :denmark:, Romania :romania:, and Sweden :sweden:.

This document describes one of the challenges for those interested in working with us. As you may have guessed, it revolves around the backend. :tada:

## Haven't applied yet? No problem!

If you've stumbled upon this document and like what you're reading, but perhaps your CV is not polished yet, don't worry! You can jump straight into one of our challenges (you only need to do one). Once done, refer to [The Handover](#the-hangover-handover) to get in touch!

## The Challenges

### Streaming Twitter Tweets

A client wants to build a web-based application (and relevant infrastructure) to stream Twitter tweets to end-users in real-time.

### Log Aggregator

Our system admins need to collect log data from all of our servers (luckily the logging agent has already been written).  The agent needs an endpoint to send data too, and the system admins need a web client to be able to view the log data.  Design and build with the future in mind - can we resell this product?

## Scope

Given the amount of work, the client has agreed to an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), but only if our best engineer is involved. This is where you come in! :tada:

Your task is to pick a few features you think are best suited for an MVP. The tech stack is completely up to you - use whichever language you're most comfortable with, and any third party libraries and tools you need to get the job done. Considering this is the MVP, your code should be architectured in a way that makes it easy to add and extend features.

She set the deadline to 3 days from your first commit but understands there are other things besides work. A quick note in a README file explaining the delay does the trick. For example:

> Ran over the time limit as birthday celebrations for auntie Linda had to be had. :beer:

## The <strike>Hangover</strike> Handover

It's completely up to you to decide how to deliver the task. GitHub, Bitbucket or any other service that's easily accessible works great. You can also upload it to e.g. Google Drive or Dropbox if that's your cup of tea. Try to avoid email attachments though.

Once uploaded, please drop your contact person from Shortcut an email with the link to the task. If you haven't been in touch with us yet, simply use the generic [post@shortcut.no](mailto:post@shortcut.no) email.

We really appreciate the time and effort it took to complete the task! :heart: We promise to return the favor as best as we can.

## The Review

Please include a README file with a quick and dirty description of your solution, the thought process, and any points you'd like to highlight. It will help us during the review, where we'll look at:

- your VCS history, with hopefully more than 1 commit
- the project structure
- the project architecture
- good coding practices
- consistent coding style and formatting
- names and naming conventions
- good use of comments
- lint warnings and code smells
- unit & integration tests
